      "NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are components of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) which provides science data to a wide community of users. The science systems of EOSDIS are managed by NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project, part of NASA’s Earth Science Data System (ESDS) Program.",
      "As custodians of NASA Earth Science data, the DAACs provide data publication, data access, and data user support. DAACs are domain-focused data repositories supporting the specific needs of science disciplines, while also enabling cross-disciplinary data usage. Table 1 lists the 12 NASA DAACs and their primary scientific disciplines.",
      "For more information on the DAACs, see the Earthdata EOSDIS DAACs page."
