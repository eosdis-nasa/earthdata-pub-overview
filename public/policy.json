            "Data from NASA science missions and some NASA research programs are automatically assigned to a DAAC by NASA ESDS.  All other data must be approved by NASA ESDS and ESDIS in order to be submitted to a DAAC for publication. This approval process is initiated by submitting the Data Publication Request form.",
            "When a Data Publication Request is received, the DAAC and the DAAC‘s User Working Group will then conduct an assessment of the data product’s alignment with the DAAC’s science domain, the scientific impact and community need, and the DAAC resources necessary to publish and support the data. The DAAC provides the information supplied in your Data Publication Request and their assessment to the NASA ESDIS project and ESDS program for review and approval.  For instructions on how to submit a Data Publication Request, see the Earthdata Pub Instructions for Data Producers page.",
