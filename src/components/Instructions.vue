                <p>On April 1-30, 2021, the EDPub Development Team conducted an initial round of Earthdata Pub user testing with members of the EDPub Information Team. Since that time, the EDPub Development and Information teams have been collaborating to prioritize and address the resulting content and usability feedback, and Earthdata Pub is now being deployed to the production environment in preparation for a second, expanded feedback solicitation.</p>
                <p>The EDPub Development Team would like to invite participants from a variety of DAAC and stakeholder roles to participate in the second round of user testing -- members of the EDPub Information Team, ESDIS Management / Engineering, DAAC Managers, DAAC Operations staff, Data Managers and QA teams, DAAC Scientists, and interested team members across the EED-3 Program.</p>
                <p>The new feedback solicitation window is slated for Aug. 25 - Sept. 17.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Please Note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no VPN requirement for testing Earthdata Pub in production.</li>
                    <li>All data entered/uploaded into the Earthdata Pub Dashboard and Forms during testing will be deleted following the close of the feedback solicitation.</li>
                    <li>Plans for external testing - The EDPub Development and Information Teams are making plans to coordinate with the DAACs on extending the Earthdata Pub feedback solicitation to UWG members on Sept. 1 - Sept. 17 (second half of the window). However, external testing will be conditional on a smooth feedback collection process to that point in time, and the go/no-go decision on UWG participation in this round will be informed by the type and quantity of DAAC and stakeholder feedback received during the first two weeks of testing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Earthdata Pub is currently in Beta testing.</p>
