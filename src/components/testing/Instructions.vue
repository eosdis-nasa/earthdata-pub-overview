                <h3 class="display-7">Background</h3>
                <p>An initial round of Earthdata Pub (EDPub) user testing was conducted internally on April 1-30, 2021. Since that time the EDPub Development and Information teams have collaborated to prioritize and address the resulting content and usability feedback. A number of high priority changes have been implemented, and as of Aug. 25, 2021, a new feedback solicitation is open for user testing of Earthdata Pub in the production environment.</p>
                <p>Participants from a variety of DAAC and stakeholder roles are invited to take part in this second round of user testing -- members of the EDPub Information Team, ESDIS Management / Engineering, DAAC Managers, DAAC Operations staff, Data Managers and QA teams, DAAC Scientists, and interested team members across the EED-3 Program.</p>
                <p>The current feedback solicitation will run <strong>Aug. 25 - Sept. 17</strong>.</p>
                <h3 class="display-7">Participation Notes</h3>
                <p>To sign up for testing, please enter your information in the form below. This is necessary to receive an email invitation to register for a login account for Earthdata Pub in production.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Sign-up Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/ep3TBgfvciTjCAjP9">https://forms.gle/ep3TBgfvciTjCAjP9</a></p>
                <p class="fw-bold">On receiving the registration link for Earthdata Pub, proceed to log in and complete the ordered tasks in the section below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no VPN requirement for testing Earthdata Pub in production.</li>
                    <li>All data entered/uploaded into the Earthdata Pub Dashboard and Forms during testing will be deleted following the close of the feedback solicitation.</li>
                    <li>Plans for external testing - The EDPub Development and Information Teams are making plans to coordinate with the DAACs on extending the Earthdata Pub feedback solicitation to UWG members on Sept. 1 - Sept. 17 (second half of the window). However, external testing will be conditional on a smooth feedback collection process to that point in time, and the go/no-go decision on UWG participation in this round will be informed by the type and quantity of DAAC and stakeholder feedback received during the first two weeks of testing.</li>
                </ul>
